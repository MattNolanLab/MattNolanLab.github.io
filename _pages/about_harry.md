Hi, Iâ€™m a postdoc in the lab looking at spatial behaviours in rodents during open field exploration and goal-direction navigation task in virtual reality. More broadly, I am interested in how the brain forges meaningful representations of the physical world to guide meaningful actions in the world.

My focus in the lab is to record intracellular activity during spatial behaviours so that we can reconcile neural dynamics with spatial behaviour. I record with techniques such as tetrode, silicon probe and NeuroPixel recording devices in mice with the aim of recording from many neurons at the same time to observe population-level neural codes.
